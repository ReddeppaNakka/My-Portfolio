      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p className="about-text">
        I’m a <span>Software Engineer</span> with a strong foundation in
        <span> AI/ML</span>, <span>backend development</span> and <span>full-stack development</span>. I enjoy building intelligent,
        scalable systems and writing clean, efficient code that solves real-world
        problems.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        My journey started with curiosity and discipline — learning the fundamentals,
        practicing daily, and applying concepts through projects and internships.
        I believe in continuous growth, strong basics, and building things that matter.
      </p>
      
      <p className="about-text">
        Over time, I have worked on projects that combine theory with hands-on
        implementation, including machine learning models, full-stack web
        applications, and API-driven systems. These experiences helped me understand
        how software behaves beyond textbooks — in real users’ hands, under real
        constraints.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        I am particularly interested in roles where I can work on
        <span> problem-solving, data-driven applications, and scalable architectures</span>.
        I enjoy breaking down complex problems into simple, logical steps and
        continuously refining solutions for better performance and reliability.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        Beyond technical skills, I value teamwork, clear communication, and a
        growth-oriented mindset. I’m comfortable learning new technologies, adapting
        to changing requirements, and contributing consistently as part of a team.
        My goal is to grow as an engineer while building software that creates real
        impact.
